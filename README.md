## üí° Why CMOS Circuits?

CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) circuits are the backbone of digital electronics due to their:

- ‚úÖ Low static power consumption  
- ‚úÖ High noise immunity  
- ‚úÖ Excellent scalability in deep submicron technologies

The **CMOS inverter** is the fundamental building block of digital ICs such as logic gates, flip-flops, memory cells, and processors. It combines the best characteristics of PMOS and NMOS transistors using:

- A **pull-up network** (PMOS)  
- A **pull-down network** (NMOS)

These transistors operate as switches, alternating between **cutoff**, **linear**, and **saturation regions** based on input conditions, thus achieving the desired inverting behavior.

## üî¨ DC Transfer Characteristic Analysis

The CMOS inverter was designed using **Cadence Virtuoso** with the **GPDK 90nm** process. Initially, both **NMOS and PMOS transistors** were sized with:

- **Width (W) = 120 nm**  
- **Length (L) = 120 nm**

This size represents the minimum feature dimension for this node.

A **DC transfer characteristic (VTC)** simulation was carried out using **ADE L**. However, the results showed that the **switching threshold** (where \( V_{\text{in}} = V_{\text{out}} \)) was **not centered at 0.5 V (i.e., V<sub>DD</sub>/2)**. Instead, it occurred at a **higher voltage**, indicating imbalance between PMOS and NMOS drive strengths. This leads to **asymmetrical noise margins**‚Äîundesirable in inverter design.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Experimental Tuning of PMOS Width

To resolve the imbalance, we **varied the PMOS width (W<sub>p</sub>)**, while **keeping NMOS width fixed at 120 nm**. A **parametric sweep** of W<sub>p</sub> was performed from **100 nm to 20000 nm**, and the corresponding VTCs were analyzed.

> üìå **Observation:** Increasing PMOS width shifted the switching threshold leftward, approaching **0.5 V**.

#### ‚úÖ Key Result:

- At approximately **W<sub>p</sub> = 415 nm**, the inverter achieved a **balanced switching threshold** close to **0.5 V**.
- This resulted in a **symmetrical VTC**, with **improved noise margins** and proper drive matching.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This experiment highlights the **critical role of transistor sizing** in CMOS logic design:

- A balanced inverter with **symmetrical noise margins** and **optimized threshold** was achieved by tuning **PMOS width**.
- Such tuning is essential when designing for high performance, robust logic in deep submicron technologies.

The methodology demonstrated here forms a key foundation for more complex digital and mixed-signal IC design workflows.
